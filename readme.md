# What is this?

Nothing yet. The goal is to be able to use [imgui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) 
inside a [vispy](http://vispy.org/) canvas.

This is very much work in progress, and does not work at the moment. My current approach 
is to go through the [cimgui](https://github.com/Extrawurst/cimgui) bindings.

I hope it's going to work.
